= 1.8.2 =

* Fixed the issue where the custom colors are applied with a slight delay. This issue was caused by the font @import statement in the beginning of the custom colors <style> block. Now, the google fonts are loaded using the link element (<link rel="stylesheet" href="...).
* Removed the bundled plugins from the theme.

= 1.8.1 =

* Changed the textdomain in the WooCommerce templates to comply with the WordPress standards.
  The following texts need to be translated in the theme: "Page %d of %d", "Search for:",

* Added: the Facebook share URL fallbacks to older (sharer) api when the APP ID is empty.
