=== Educator ===

A clean and elegant theme created to make it easy to sell online courses. Supports the Educator and the WooCommerce plugins.

== Documentation ==

The theme's documentation is published on the educatorplugin.com website:

- Theme description - http://educatorplugin.com/themes/educator/
- Theme setup instructions - http://educatorplugin.com/educator-theme-setup/
- Documentation - http://educatorplugin.com/category/documentation/themes/educator/

== Custom plugins ==

The theme includes a few custom plugins (stored in light weight ".zip" packages), but it doesn't depend on these plugins, and it doesn't activate them automatically. These plugins are stored in the "include/plugins" directory. The TGM Plugin Activation Class will prompt you to install them, when you activate the theme, but it's not mandatory.
